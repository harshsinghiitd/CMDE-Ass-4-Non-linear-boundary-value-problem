# CMDE-Ass-4-Non-linear-boundary-value-problem
Implement finite difference method scheme/program for solving non-linear boundary value problem:


y’’ = f(x, y, y’); x belongs to [a, b]; y(a) = α and y(b) = 

Test this scheme for an example problem like:
Y’’ + (y’)2 = 1; y(0) = 1; y(1) = 2; h = 0.25.

Plot the graph of solution y.

Note that:
1. Proper documentation should be used in the codes
2. You have to submit a program. Name of the file should be: “Ass4_EntryNu”
3. There will be evaluation of this assignment during some practical session, you will
be informed before.
4. Total Marks for this assignment = 4.
5. No cheating allowed.
